# Sorting Visualizer
Responsive visualizer built using Javascript for popular algorithms.
The algorithms include:
- bubble sort
- selection sort
- insertion sort
- merge sort (In-place)
- quick sort (In-place)

I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action.
